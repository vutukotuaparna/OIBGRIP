<p>
				☛ Mother Teresa was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje*, Macedonia, on August 26**, 1910. Her family was of Albanian descent.<br><br>
				☛ At the age of twelve, she felt strongly the call of God. She knew she had to be a missionary to spread the love of Christ. <br><br>
				☛ Mother Teresa was one of the great servants of humanity. She was an Albanian Catholic nun who came to India, founded the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, and attained Indian citizenship.<br><br>
				☛ Her selfless work among the poverty-stricken people of Kolkata (Calcutta) is an inspiration for people all over the world and she was honored with Nobel Prize for her work.
				<br><br> ☛ She started an open-air school for homeless children. Soon she was joined by voluntary helpers, and she received financial support from church organizations and the municipal authorities. On October 7, 1950, Mother Teresa received permission from the Vatican to start her own order.</strong>
				<br><br> ☛ Vatican originally labeled the order as the Diocesan Congregation of the Calcutta Diocese, and it later came to be known as the "Missionaries of Charity." 
				<br><br> ☛ The primary task of the Missionaries of Charity was to take care of those persons who nobody was prepared to look after.
				<br><br> ☛ The Society of Missionaries has spread all over the world, including the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. They provide effective help to the poorest of the poor in a number of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and they undertake relief work in the wake of natural catastrophes such as floods, epidemics, and famine, and for refugees.
				<br><br> ☛ Mother Teresa’s work has been recognised and acclaimed throughout the world and she has received a number of awards and distinctions, including the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971) and the Nehru Prize for her promotion of international peace and understanding (1972). 
				<br><br> ☛ Her order also opened numerous centres serving the blind, the aged, and the disabled.
				<br><br> ☛ Under Mother Teresa’s guidance, the Missionaries of Charity built a leper colony, called Shanti Nagar (“Town of Peace”), near Asansol, India.
				<br><br> ☛ In 1979 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her humanitarian work, and the following year the Indian government conferred on her the Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour.
				<br><br> ☛ She remained in charge of her congregation as long as health permitted her to, continuing to serve among her people, and died in her Calcutta the age of 87.
